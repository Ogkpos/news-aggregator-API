**Key Features:**

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up using their email and password. The API also supports session management, Multi-factor authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- Preferences Management: Users can set interests, preferred news sources, and keywords for customized news aggregation.
- News Aggregation: The API fetches articles from various RSS feeds based on the user's preferences.
- Saved Articles: Users can save articles for later reading.
- Share Articles: Users can share articles amongst themselves.
- Comment Articles: Users can comment on an article
- Advanced Search: Users can perform keyword-based searches across multiple sources.
- Error Handling: Detailed and consistent error handling throughout the
  entire application

**Prerequisites:**

To run the API locally, you will need the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB (locally or a hosted instance, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- You also need to configure environment variables. Use the provided .env example file as a reference.
